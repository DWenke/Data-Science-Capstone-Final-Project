# Data-Science-Capstone-Final-Project
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

This GitHub Repository includes: 
    - A text prediction Shiny app URL (running on shinyapps.io); input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box 
      and outputs a prediction of the next word.
    - A slide deck created with R Studio Presenter (R Pubs) pitching the algorithm and app to potential investors
    - Data files from blogs, twitter and news
